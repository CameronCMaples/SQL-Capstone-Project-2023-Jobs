## Introduction
üìä Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores  top-paying jobs,  in-demand skills, and üìà where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

üîç Check out my SQL queries here: [SQL_project folder](/SQL_Project/)

```sql
SELECT skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    -- AND job_work_from_home = true
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
